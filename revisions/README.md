# wpt.fyi revisions-of-interest announcer

This directory (`golang` package) contains the source code for a service that announces *revisions-of-interest* to `wpt.fyi`. Test runners reporting to `wpt.fyi` are expected to prioritize running against revisions-of-interest from the [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) repository.
