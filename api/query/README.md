# wpt.fyi Search queries

wpt.fyi supports a structured search syntax, allowing the user to filter specific results.

## wpt.fyi search syntax

As outlined below, the `/api/search` endpoint takes a structured query object. wpt.fyi's
UI contains a search-box that converts a search syntax into the required structured query.
Listed below are the "atoms" that can be used in a search.

### Status

Filters to results with a specific status (or, _not_ a specific status).

Valid statuses are:

 - `unknown`
 - `pass`
 - `ok`
 - `error`
 - `timeout`
 - `notrun`
 - `fail`
 - `crash`
 - `skip`
 - `assert`

> NOTE: `ok` is the status of the test harness setup. Individual subtests will have
> a status of `pass` - it may be necessary to search for both.

There are a couple of different ways to filter by status.

#### Any product

    status:[status]

or, negation,

    status:![status]


#### Specific product

    [product]:[status]

Where `[product]` is a product specification (e.g. `safari`, `chrome-69`).

### And-conjuction

    [query1] and [query2] [and ...]

Combines filters, such that they must all apply, e.g.

    chrome:pass and firefox:!pass

### Or-conjuction

    [query1] or [query2] [or ...]

Combines filters, such that any must apply, e.g.

    chrome:pass or chrome:ok

> NOTE: Or-conjuction takes less precedence than `and`. Precedence can be modified
> using parens, e.g. `chrome:pass and (firefox:!pass or safari:!pass)`

### Sequential

    seq([query1] [query2] [...])

Combines filters such that they must apply to runs sequentially. This is mainly
useful when there are multiple runs with the same product, e.g. to find a regression

    seq(status:pass status:fail)

### Count

> BETA: This feature is under development and may change without warning.

    count:[number]([query1] [query2])

Requires that the number of results matching the given query/queries is precisely
the given count. For example, this search atom can be used to find cases where
exactly one result is a failure:

    count:1(status:fail)

Note that there are some special keywords for count:1, count:2, and count:3
(`one`, `two` and `three` respectively). For example, to find results where
Safari is the only one missing a result:

    three(status:!missing) safari:missing

## /api/search

The `/api/search` endpoint takes an HTTP `POST` method, where the body is of the format

    {
      "run_ids": [123, 456, ...],
      "q": {
        [Structured query]
      }
    }

> NOTE: If, rather than a specific set of runs, the user wishes to query for the latest
> results for a set of products, the `/api/search` endpoint supports the same query
> parameters as /api/runs, outlined [in the API docs](../README.md)

### Structured query objects

Structured query objects are produced by the syntax parser on wpt.fyi.

The easiest way to build the query you need is to use the syntax above, and inspect
the outgoing HTTP `POST` body.

#### exists

`exists` query objects perform a disjunction of all of the runs, in order to ensure
that each of its queries is satisfied _by the same run_. This matters for the case
that there are multiple runs with the same product.

    {"exists": [query1, query2, ...]}

#### sequential

`sequential` query objects perform an ordered disjunction of all of the runs.
Like exists, the queries must be satisfied by the same run, but in addition, the order
of the queries must be satisfied by the runs, in order.

    {"sequential": [query1, query2, ...]}

#### and

    {"and": [query1, query2, ...]}

#### or

    {"or": [query1, query2, ...]}

#### status

Takes a string of the status to match.

    {"status": "ok"}

#### status not

A not-clause for the given status.

    {"status": {"not": "fail"} }

#### product status

Same as satuts, but with a specific product-spec.

    {
      "product": "chrome-69",
      "status": "ok",
    }

#### link

`link` query atoms perform a search for tests that have some matching link metadata.

    {"link": pattern}

 E.g.

Search untriaged issues -

    chrome:fail and !link:bugs.chromium.org

Search triaged issues -

    chrome:pass and link:bugs.chromium.org
