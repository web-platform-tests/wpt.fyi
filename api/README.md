## TestRun entities

`TestRun` entities represent metadata about an execution of the [wpt](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) test suite, on a particular product. Tests are run on a regular basis, and each entry in `/api/runs` annotates when the tests were executed, which product they were executed on, and the where the results are stored.

### /api/runs

Gets the TestRun metadata for all runs for a given SHA[0:10], sorted by `time_start` descending.

__Parameters__

__`sha`__ : SHA[0:10] of the runs to get, or the keyword `latest`. Defaults to `latest`.

__`product`__ : Product(s) to include (repeated param), e.g. `chrome` or `firefox-60`.

__`aligned`__ : boolean for whether to get only SHAs which were executed across all of the requested `product`s.

__`labels`__: A comma-separated list of labels, e.g. `firefox,stable`; only runs with all
the given labels will be returned. There are currently two kinds of labels supported,
browser names (`chrome`, `edge`, `firefox`, `safari`) and release channels (`experimental`
or `stable`).

__`from`__ : RFC3339 timestamp, for which to include runs that occured after the given time.
NOTE: Runs are sorted by `time_start` descending, so be wary when combining this parameter
with the `max-count` parameter below.

__`to`__ : RFC3339 timestamp, for which to include runs that occured before the given time.

__`max-count`__ : Maximum number of runs to get (for each browser). Maximum of 500.

#### staging.wpt.fyi only (Beta params)

__`pr`__ (Beta): GitHub PR number. Shows runs for commits that belong to the PR.

## Results summaries

The following methods apply to the results summaries JSON blobs, which are linked to from
[TestRun entities](#test-run-entities).

### /api/results

Performs an HTTP redirect for the results summary JSON blob of the given TestRun.

__Response format__

The summary JSON is in the format

    {
      "/path/to/test.html": [1, 1],
    }

Where the array contains [`number of passes`, `total tests`].

__Parameters__

__`product`__ : Product to fetch the results for, e.g. `chrome-66`

__`sha`__ : SHA[0:10] of the TestRun to fetch, or the keyword `latest`. Defaults to `latest`.

#### Example

https://wpt.fyi/api/results?product=chrome

<details><summary><b>Example JSON</b> (from the summary.json.gz output)</summary>

    {
      "/css/css-text/i18n/css3-text-line-break-opclns-213.html": [1, 1],
      "/css/css-writing-modes/table-progression-vrl-001.html": [1, 1],
      // ...
    }

</details>

### /api/diff

Computes a summary JSON blob of the differences between two TestRun summary blobs,
in the format of an array of [improved, regressed, total-delta].

__Parameters__

__`before`__ : [product]@[sha] spec for the TestRun to use as the before state.

__`after`__ : [product]@[sha] spec for the TestRun to use as the after state.

__`path`__ : Test path to filter by. `path` is a repeatable query parameter.

__`filter`__ : Differences to include in the summary.
 - `A` : Added - tests which are present after, but not before.
 - `D` : Deleted - tests which are present before, but not after.
 - `C` : Changed - tests which are present before and after, but the results summary is different.
 - `U` : Unchanged - tests which are present before and after, and the results summary count is not different.

### /api/interop

Gets TestRun interoperability metadata, for the runs that would be fetched
using the same params calling [/api/runs](#apiruns).

Note that if a subset of browsers are selected, the most recent interoperability
metadata that includes all of the browsers is return (which may have been
computed from more than the returned browsers). For example,
`/api/interop?product=chrome-67` will return interoperability metadata that
includes the results from the latest run of Chrome 67.0.

__Parameters__

__`sha`__ : SHA[0:10] of the runs to get, or the keyword `latest`. Defaults to `latest`.

__`product`__ : Product(s) to include (repeated param), e.g. `chrome` or `firefox-60`.

__`labels`__: A comma-separated list of labels, e.g. `firefox,stable`; only runs with all
the given labels will be returned. There are currently two kinds of labels supported,
browser names (`chrome`, `edge`, `firefox`, `safari`) and release channels (`experimental`
or `stable`).

__`from`__ : RFC3339 timestamp, for which to include runs that occured after the given time.
NOTE: Runs are sorted by `time_start` descending, so be wary when combining this parameter
with the `max-count` parameter below.

__`to`__: RFC3339 timestamp, for which to include runs that occured before the given time.

__`max-count`__ : Maximum number of runs to get (for each browser). Maximum of 500.

## Test Manifest

The following methods apply to the retrieval and filtering of the Test Manifest in [WPT](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt),
which contains metadata about each test.

### /api/manifest

Gets the JSON of the WPT manifest GitHub release asset, for a given `sha` (defaults to latest).

__Parameters__

__`sha`__ : SHA of the [WPT](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) repo PR for which to fetch,
    the manifest, or the keyword `latest`. (Defaults to `latest`.)

NOTE: The full SHA of the fetched manifest is returned in the HTTP response header `X-WPT-SHA`, e.g.

    X-WPT-SHA: abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01

__Response format__

The high-level structure of the `v4` manifest is as follows:

    {
      "items": {
        "manual": {
            "file/path": [
              manifest_item,
              ...
            ],
            ...
        },
        "reftest": {...},
        "testharness": {...},
        "visual", {...},
        "wdspec": {...},
      },
    }

`manifest_item` is an **array** (nested in the map's `"file/path"` value's array) with varying contents. Loosely,

- For `testharness` entries: `[url, extras]`
  - `extras` example: `{"timeout": "long", "testdriver": True}`
- For `reftest` entries: `[url, references, extras]`
  - `references` example: `[[reference_url1, "=="], [reference_url2, "!="], ...]`
  - `extras` example: `{"timeout": "long", "viewport_size": ..., "dpi": ...}`

## Results creation

### /api/results/upload

Uploads a wptreport to the dashboard to create the test run.

This endpoint only accepts POST requests. Requests need to be authenticated via HTTP basic auth.
Please contact [Ecosystem Infra](mailto:ecosystem-infra@chromium.org) if you want to register as a
"test runner", to upload results.

#### File payload

__Content type__: `multipart/form-data`

__Parameters__

__`labels`__: (Optional) A comma-separated string of labels for this test run. Currently recognized
labels are "experimental" and "stable" (the release channel of the tested browser).

__`callback_url`__: (Optional) A URL that the processor should `POST` when successful, which will
create the TestRun. Defaults to /api/results/create in the current project's environment (e.g. wpt.fyi for
wptdashboard, staging.wpt.fyi for wptdashboard-staging).

__`result_file`__: A **gzipped** JSON file produced by `wpt run --log-wptreport`.
This field can be repeated to include multiple files (for chunked reports).

__`screenshot_file`__: A **gzipped** screenshot database produced by `wpt run --log-screenshot`.
This field can be repeated to include multiple links (for chunked reports).

The JSON file roughly looks like this:

```json
{
  "results": [...],
  "time_start": MILLISECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH,
  "time_end": MILLISECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH,
  "run_info": {
    "revision": "WPT revision of the test run",
    "product": "your browser",
    "browser_version": "version of the browser",
    "os": "your os",
    "os_version": "OPTIONAL OS version",
    ...
  }
}
```

__Notes__

The `time_start` and `time_end` fields are numerical timestamps (in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch)
when the whole test run starts and finishes. They are optional, but encouraged. `wpt run` produces
them in the report by default.

`run_info.{revision,product,browser_version,os}` are required, and should be automatically
generated by `wpt run`. If for some reason the report does not contain these fields (e.g. old WPT
version, Sauce Labs, or custom runners), they can be overridden with the following *optional*
parameters in the POST payload (this is __NOT__ recommended; please include metadata in the reports
whenever possible):

* __`revision`__ (note this should be the full revision hash, not a 10-char truncation)
* __`browser_name`__ (note that it is not called `product` here)
* __`browser_version`__
* __`os_name`__ (note that it is not called `os` here)
* __`os_version`__

#### URL payload

__Content type__: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

__Parameters__

__`result_url`__: A URL to a **gzipped** JSON file produced by `wpt run --log-wptreport` (see above
for its format). This field can be repeated to include multiple links (for chunked reports).

__`screenshot_url`__: A URL to a **gzipped** screenshot database produced by `wpt run --log-screenshot`.
This field can be repeated to include multiple links (for chunked reports).

__`callback_url`__: (Optional) A URL that the processor should `POST` when successful, which will
create the TestRun. Defaults to /api/results/create in the current project's environment (e.g. wpt.fyi for
wptdashboard, staging.wpt.fyi for wptdashboard-staging).

__`labels`__: (Optional) A comma-separated string of labels for this test run. Currently recognized
labels are "experimental" and "stable" (the release channel of the tested browser).

### /api/results/create

This is an *internal* endpoint used by the results processor.

## Announcement of revisions-of-interest

The `/api/revisions` namespace contains APIs for accessing WPT
_revisions-of-interest_. The primary use case for this API is synchronizing the
WPT revision used by active test runners.

In rare cases, [this namespace may go offline without advanced
notice](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt.fyi/issues/802). Users should
allow 10 minutes for the service to return before reporting an issue.

### /api/revisions/epochs

Get the collection of epochs over which revisions are announced. For example,
the `two_hourly` epoch announces the last revision prior to every two-hour
interval (for each day: last revision prior to midnight, 2AM, 4AM, etc.). Weeks
start on Monday. All epochs calculated relative to UTC times.

__Parameters__

### /api/revisions/list

List a particular range of revision. This API allows the client to query for
announced revisions for particular epochs, a particular time range, etc..

__Parameters__

__`epochs`__ : A potentially repeated parameter. Each parameter value contains
the `id` of some epoch known by the announcer. Defaults to all known epochs.

__`num_revisions`__: The number of epochal revisions _for each epoch in `epochs`
values_ to include in the response. Defaults to 100. Response will include an
`error` field when fewer than the requested number could be found for some
epoch(s).

__`at`__ : An RFC3339-encoded timestamp describing the upper limit on the time
range for fetching epochal revisions. Defaults to now.

__`start`__: An RFC3339-encoded timestamp describing the lower limit on the time
range for fetching epochal revisions. Defaults to the date which is
`num_revisions * longest(epochs).max_duration_sec` seconds prior to now.

## Querying test results

### /api/search

Search for test results over some set of test runs.

__Parameters__

__`run_ids`__ : Array-separated list of numerical ids associated with the runs
over which to search. IDs associated with runs can be obtained by querying the
`/api/runs` API. Defaults to the default runs returned by `/api/runs`.

__`q`__: Query string for search. Only results data for tests that contain the
`q` value as a substring of the test name will be returned. Defaults to the
empty string, which will yield all test results for the selected runs.
