        These scores represent how well browser engines are doing on the 2021
        Compat Focus Areas, as measured by wpt.fyi test results. Each feature
        contributes up to 20 points to the score, based on passing-test
        percentage, giving a maximum possible score of 100 for each browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        The set of tests used is derived from the full wpt.fyi test suite for
        each feature, filtered by believed importance to web developers.
